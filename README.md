# Tauri + Next.js + Typescript

## About

This is my testing ground to check out the fantastic [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) to make a desktop application to show the local wheather in Sweden at the moment. I'm using the [OpenWeatherMap Api](https://openweathermap.org/).
